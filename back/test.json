Given a Lie group action that generates transport\nalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie\ngroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding\nLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group\nintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary\ndifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are\nuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.\nLastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid\nbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by\ntwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2007 11:05:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2007 10:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-16","authors_parsed":[["Malham","Simon J.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades.
